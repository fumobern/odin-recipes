				<h3>Ingredients</h3>
				<ul>

					<li>1 cup almond meal</li>
					<li>1 ⅓ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Steps</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
					<li>Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, about 5 minutes. Whisk superfine sugar into egg whites until thick, glossy, and stiff peaks form, 5 to 8 minutes more.</li>
					<li>Sift almond meal and confectioners' sugar over beaten egg whites; gently fold in, retaining as much air as possible.</li>
					<li>Divide meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if desired.</li>
					<li>Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip. Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
					<li>Let cookies stand at room temperature to form a thin skin, about 15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Lift the baking sheets; let drop from several inches above the work surface to adhere cookies to the baking sheets.</li>
					<li>Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes; let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the parchment paper, about 45 minutes.</li>
